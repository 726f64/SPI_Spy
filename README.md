# SPI_Spy
A simple SPI data grabber and display on LCD module for visual inspection.

This project was sat on one of my old local HDD and started to fall into disrepair.
I've pushed it to Github so I can find it quickly and be able to modify the code from various locations to 
hopefully produce a beter working version.

I initially made this device so I could capture the SPI data that was running between the MCU and the 
RF transceiver on one of the Xyloband LED wristbands (as issued out for the Coldplay Head Full of Dreams Tour).
